#Group Butler
This bot has been created to help people in the administration of a group.

This bot is based on Otouto (Telegram bot: [@mokubot](https://telegram.me/mokubot), github page: [topkecleon/otouto](https://github.com/topkecleon/otouto).).

Otouto and Group Butler are licensed under the GNU General Public License. A copy of the license has been included in [LICENSE](https://github.com/topkecleon/otouto/blob/master/LICENSE).

##What is it?
Group Butler is a Telegram API bot written in Lua. It has been created to help the members of a group to keep it clean and regulated, from the point of view of administrators and normal users.

This bot takes its structure from Otouto: it's plugin-based. This makes easier to manage each function and command of the bot, and allows to split the different capabilities of it in different files for a more specific vision of what it should do.

##Setup
You **must** have Lua (5.2+), LuaSocket, LuaSec and Redis-Lua installed.

How to install LuaRocks and set-up the modules:
```bash
# Download and install LuaSocket, LuaSec adn Redis-Lua

$ wget http://luarocks.org/releases/luarocks-2.2.2.tar.gz
$ tar zxpf luarocks-2.2.2.tar.gz
$ cd luarocks-2.2.2
$ ./configure; sudo make bootstrap
$ sudo luarocks install luasocket
$ sudo luarocks install luasec
$ sudo luarocks install redis-lua
$ cd ..
```
Clone the github repository:
```bash
# Clone the repo

$ git clone https://github.com/RememberTheAir/GroupButler.git
$ cd GroupButler
```

**First of all, take a look to your bot settings:**

> • Make sure that privacy is disabled, otherwise the bot won't see replied messages unless they starts with '/'. Write `/setprivacy` to [BotFather](http://telegram.me/BotFather) to check the current setting.

**Before you do anything, open config.lua in a text editor and make the following changes:**

> • Set bot_api_key to the authentication token you received from the [BotFather](http://telegram.me/BotFather).
>
> • Set admin as your Telegram ID.

Before start the bot, you have to start Redis. Open a new window and type:
```bash
# Start Redis

$ redis-server

# Don't close the window!
```

##MUST READ!!!

Before stop the bot, if you don't want to loose your redis datas (read: statistics and moderation), you have to perform a background saves.

There are three ways to do this: use `/halt` command to stop the bot (datas will be saved automatically), use `/redis save` command to save datas (and then stop the bot), or open a terminal window and run `redis-cli bgsave` (and then stop the bot).

Please remember to do one of this easy things in order to avoid to loose important informations.

I wrote this here cause is always better to say this stuffs before start the bot for the first time. Now you have been warned!

##Set a time offset and start the process

You may also want to set your time_offset (a positive or negative number, in seconds, representing your computer's difference from UTC).

To start the bot, run `./launch.sh`. To stop the bot, press Ctrl+c twice.

You may also start the bot with `lua bot.lua`, but then it will not restart automatically.

Interactions with the Telegram bot API are straightforward. Every function is named the same as the API method it utilizes. The order of expected arguments is laid out in bindings.lua.

There are three functions which are not API methods: sendRequest, curlRequest, and sendReply. The first two are used by the other functions. sendReply is used directly. It expects the "msg" table as its first argument, and a string of text as its second. It will send a reply without image preview to the initial message.

* * *

Several functions and methods used by multiple plugins and possibly the main script are kept in utilities.lua. Refer to that file for documentation.

Group Butler uses dkjson, a pure-Lua JSON parser. This is provided with the code and does not need to be downloaded or installed separately.

##Short general FAQs

*Q*: Why Lua?
*A*: I like Lua. It's an easy, poweful and fun language, and most important, one of the few languages I know. So why something else? :)

*Q*: Why Otouto?
*A*: In my opinion, Otouto has a really good plugins structure, and considering the amount if commands I've planned for Group Butler, I thought that its structure is perfect and fits my needs better than everything else. Using it means save a lot of time trying to do it by myself.
Bindings are ok and easy to understand for everyone, I like how the bot run, but I've edited some lines aswell. For example, I don't like how triggers match the text, so I've switched to something more familiar. And other secondary modifications here and there, take a look to the commits for further informations.
