#Group Butler
This bot have been created to help people in the administration of a group.

This bot is based on Otouto (Telegram bot: [@mokubot](https://telegram.me/mokubot), github page: [topkecleon/otouto](https://github.com/topkecleon/otouto).).

otouto and group butler are licensed under the GNU General Public License. A copy of the license has been included in [LICENSE](https://github.com/topkecleon/otouto/blob/master/LICENSE).

##What is it?
Group butler is a Telegram API bot written in Lua. It has been created to help the members of a group to keep it clean and regulated, from the point of view of administrators and normal users.

This bot takes its structure from otouto: it's plugin-based. This makes easier to manage each functions and commands of the bot, and allows to split the different capabilities of it in different files for a more specific vision of what it should do.

##Setup
You **must** have Lua (5.2+), LuaSocket, and LuaSec installed. For uploading photos and other files, you must have curl installed.


**Before you do anything, open config.lua in a text editor and make the following changes:**

> • Set bot_api_key to the authentication token you received from the Botfather.
>
> • Set admin as your Telegram ID.

You may also want to set your time_offset (a positive or negative number, in seconds, representing your computer's difference from UTC).

To start the bot, run `./launch.sh`. To stop the bot, press Ctrl+c twice.

You may also start the bot with `lua bot.lua`, but then it will not restart automatically.

##Development
Everybody is free to contribute to otouto and to group butler. Here I will explain various things that are important to know about the plugin system.

The on_msg_receive function adds a few variables to the "msg" table: msg.from.id_str, msg.to.id_str, msg.text_lower. These are self-explanatory and can make your code a lot neater.

Return values from the action function are optional, but when they are used, they determine the fate of the message. When false/nil is returned, on_msg_receive stops and the script moves on to waiting for the next message. When true is returned, on_msg_receive continues going through the plugins for a match. When a table is returned, that table becomes the "msg" table, and on_msg_receive continues.

When a plugin action or cron function fails, the script will catch the error and print it, and, if applicable, the text which triggered the plugin, and continue.

Interactions with the Telegram bot API are straightforward. Every function is named the same as the API method it utilizes. The order of expected arguments is laid out in bindings.lua.

There are three functions which are not API methods: sendRequest, curlRequest, and sendReply. The first two are used by the other functions. sendReply is used directly. It expects the "msg" table as its first argument, and a string of text as its second. It will send a reply without image preview to the initial message.

Several functions and methods used by multiple plugins and possibly the main script are kept in utilities.lua. Refer to that file for documentation.

Group butler uses dkjson, a pure-Lua JSON parser. This is provided with the code and does not need to be downloaded or installed separately.
